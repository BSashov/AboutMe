        <h1>Igniting <br>the Spark</h1>
        <p>From an early age, I was fascinated by the beauty of mathematics and the boundless potential of technology.
          It wasn't until I discovered the world of design, however, that I truly found my calling. I immersed myself in
          every aspect of this thrilling field, studying at the prestigious High School of Mathematics and the New
          Bulgarian University's cutting-edge Computer Graphics and Design program.</p>

        <h1>Journey in the World of Design</h1>
        <p>As my skills grew, I was eager to test myself in the fast-paced world of design. I began my journey as a
          lecturer, sharing my love of technology and design with others. From there, I took on challenging roles in
          pre-press and design at a top printing house before making the bold move to Germany. There, I left my mark on
          the design world by creating powerful brand identities and developing a modern job searching platform
          for medical experts.</p>

      <div class="story_section">
        <h1>Learn, Aspire,<br> Achieve</h1>
        <p>But my passion for design didn't stop there. I continued to push the boundaries of what was possible, taking
          on a role at a leading marketing agency. There, I spearheaded the creation and marketing of a comprehensive
          website builder that revolutionized the way pharmacies and small pharmaceutical companies showcased their
          services and products. The stunning designs I created not only caught the eye of customers but earned critical
          acclaim from industry experts as well.</p>

          project, I'm eager to take on new challenges and continue honing my skills. I'm confident that my unique
          background in mathematics, technology, and design, combined with my boundless creativity, make me an asset to
          any team. So why not join me on this thrilling journey and let's create something amazing together?</p>
